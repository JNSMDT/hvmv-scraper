## Description

The local handball federation has discontinued the ability to provide league data via a CSV. To view the match data of the respective clubs, you have to go to the [HVMV](https://hvmv.de/nu-liga/ergebnisse/) page all the time. That's why we can't display the data on our own site anymore.
The solution is a scraper that extract the important data from the given pages.
